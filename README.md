Pricing Forecast Modeling with Facebook's Prophet Library

Background on FB Prophet:

"Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. 
It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. 
Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well."

A FB Prophet forecasting model was constructed in an attempt to forecast open exchange ad prices. This model was developed to be evaluated
against the SARIMAX model that was developed in the other notebook.
